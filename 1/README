Description:
My shell takes input from either stdin or a batchfile as an argument. To read the batchfile, I use freopen. To read stdin, I use feof with a while loop and parse the input with strtok. 

To solve all the custom commmands, I tried a lot of things in the shell to see what does what. The system function is very helpful for a lot of the commands, but the rest are solved through sysyscalls. 

One of the most helpful functions I found was the strcat function with concatenates strings. THis is helpful because the code is parsed to start with and a few of the commands require the code by concatenated before it is used.

The mimic and morph commands both required me to read from and write to files. This was a new skill for me. After reading, I write to by coping each char individually to the write file. 

If the custom commands do not exist, all other commands are parsed, concatenated, and passed to system to be redirected and made useful.


Directions:

Custom commands work as follows:

wipe - invokes system("clear");

esc - exits with 0 parameter to signify successful exit.

filez - if there are no arguments, it calls system("ls -r"); else it prints the file.

environ - steps through the environment while it exists and prints it out. 

ditto - concatenates the string passed to it and then prints it.

help - prints this README by calling system("cat /projects/1/README");

mimic - copies the first file bit by bit and writes it to the second file.

erase - removes the file passed to it.

morph - copies the first file bit by bit and writes it to the second file, deleting the first.

chdir - changes directory by calling the chdir function and then sets the environment to the new directory.

All other shell commands are passed to the system() function to be invoked. 

Bugs:
I believe my stdin works mostly as required. But I have problems matching the expected output with a batchfile argument.
