Description
The first thing I do in my program is add the STDIN to a FILE pointer and create an array of size 255. 
To solve the problem of printing ASCII values and their occurences, my program is structured using a 
switch statement. This switch determines how many arugments are passed to the program. The options are 
1, 2, or 3. Once this is determined, the code does nearly the same thing in all three cases, with some 
minor differences. I enter a while loop to continue until EOF is reached. Until then, the count of ASCII 
values are increased within an array. When the EOF is reached, the array is then printed to show the 
number of times each ascii value occurs according to the project description. The file is then closed 
and the switch statement is exited, thus ending the program. 

The difficulties of solving the program mostly happened in the while loop for me. I was struggling to 
collect null values because I was failing to realize that while(c = fgetc(fileInput) was returning a 0 
value, and breaking my loop. Once I created an infinite loop, this problem was fixed.

I used GeeksforGeeks to understand the functions I could perform on the FILE pointer, primarily the 
fgetc function (https://geeksforgeeks.org/fgetc-fputc-c/).
